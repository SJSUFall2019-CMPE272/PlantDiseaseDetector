       <p>Agriculture in the United States is a major driver of economic growth, 
           accounting for 11% percent of total employment and $132.8 billion dollars to U.S
           . GDP in 2017 [1]. Increasing efficiency and reducing waste is a key research
            area in agricultural, particularly as climate change creates
             favorable conditions for pests and diseases to proliferate 
             throughout a crop.</p>
             <p> Our project provides a tool to help farmers discover diseases 
             within their crop by using IBMâ€™s visual recognition API to identify diseases of 
             interest to farm owners. The tool provides farmers a platform to train a machine 
             learning model customized to their problem while also providing a dashboard for 
             visualizing past predictions, if needed. The model is trained and validated on 
             the PlantVillage-Dataset.</p>
